Hi, I'm Claire!ðŸ‘‹ I'm a 4th Year computer science student studying in Trinity College Dublin. I have a particular interest in technical infrastructure, and how systems work. I love well written and well-structured code.

I'm currently looking for a 6-8 month internship starting in January 2024.

## Work experience
### Lab Demonstrator
*2022-Present*

I was selected for these roles based on my academic performance. I worked as a demonstrator and advisor in labs for the following modules:
- **Introduction to Programming:** A year 1 Computer Science module teaching Java.
- **Computer Engineering I:** A year 1 Engineering module teaching C++.

I am currently working as a demonstrator for **Computer Networks**, a year 3 computer science module. For this module, I am also assisting in grading.

### Google Internship (SRE Intern)
*Summer 2023*

In this 13 week internship, I worked independently to create a metadata integrity checker. I consulted with my team, located in India, Ireland, and the USA, to design the checker from the ground up. I wrote a private API which performs 5 checks on this metadata, alerting when an error is found. I worked with another team to automate this check. 

Previously, metadata errors could cause incidents without warning. My work ensured metadata issues are noticed, and allowed long term debugging of metadata errors. I added reliability against failure to an existing Google product. The API which implements the checks is easily modifiable to add more checks. The project should save up to 50 engineering hours per year. I did this work in Java, practicing CI/CD, and implementing monitoring.

### Google Internship (STEP - Student Training in Engineering Program)
*Summer 2022*

In this 12 week internship, I worked with a partner to integrate server calls into a command line interface. These were required for certain commands to run. Previously, these server calls had to be done manually by calling 2 other command line interfaces before running the intended command. Our work made this tool easier and more efficient to use. I did this work in Go, and submitted over 50 commits personally, practising CI/CD.
